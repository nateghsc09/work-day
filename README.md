# work-day

This app is a work day planer

It has a seperate section for each hour of the work day so that someone could put in a task and then save it for later. 

It shows the live date and time on the top of the page.

Each hour section will change to orange if it is that current hour, and then red once that hour has passed durring the day. 

If you hit the save button after typeing somehting in, then all of your information will be saved even if you refresh the page. 

Using local storage we can keep all of saved text. 

Working on making it look a litte bit nicer but it is funtioning!
